===========

Inferential is a web application that houses several large language models to run inference locally

--Example of inference

This project helps those at a beginner programming level understand the fundamentals of large language models, tokenization, and API's. This web application follows an encoder-decoder format where a query is sent to the API where it will encode the query into tokens, generate a response in tokens, and then decode those tokens into readable text.
