# Saliva.GPT

The goal of the project is to allow users to use AI in a playground setting.

# Description

What your application does,
Why you used the technologies you used,
Some of the challenges you faced and features you hope to implement in the future.

# How to Use the Project

Provide instructions and examples so users/contributors can use the project. This will make it easy for them in case they encounter a problem â€“ they will always have a place to reference what is expected.

You can also make use of visual aids by including materials like screenshots to show examples of the running project and also the structure and design principles used in your project.

Also if your project will require authentication like passwords or usernames, this is a good section to include the credentials.
