<h1>Inferential</h1>
<h2>About</h2>
<p>
  Inferential is a web application that houses several large language models to
  run them locally.
</p>
<p>
  This project helps those at a beginner programming level understand the
  fundamentals of large language models, tokenization, and APIs. It also easily
  allows and provides an interface to load and run large language models
  locally.
</p>
<p>
  This web application follows an encoder-decoder format where a query is sent
  to the API where it will encode the query into tokens, generate a response in
  tokens, and then decode those tokens into readable text.
</p>
