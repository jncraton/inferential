        <summary><b>What is Inferential?</b></summary>
        Inferential is a web application that houses several large language
        models to run them locally.
        <br />
        <br />
        This project helps those at a beginner programming level understand the
        fundamentals of large language models, tokenization, and API's. This web
        application follows an encoder-decoder format where a query is sent to
        the API where it will encode the query into tokens, generate a response
        in tokens, and then decode those tokens into readable text.

        <summary><b>How do I run inferential locally?</b></summary>
        Clone the git repository
        <br />
        <br />
        ```sh
        <br />
        git clone git@github.com:jncraton/inferential.git
        <br />
        ```
        <br />
        <br />
        ```sh
        <br />
        pip install requirements.txt
        <br />
        ```
        <br />
        <br />
        If pip install does not work here is the alternative
        <br />
        <br />
        ```sh
        <br />
        python -m pip install requirements.txt
        <br />
        ```
        <br />
        <br />
        Run the web application
        <br />
        <br />
        ```sh
        <br />
        flask run
        <br />
        ```
        <br />
        <br />
        If this does not work here is the alternative
        <br />
        <br />
        ```sh
        <br />
        python -m flask run
        <br />
        ```
        <br />
        <br />
        Basic python script to communicate with the API
        <br />
        <br />
        ```python
        <br />
        import requests
        <br />
        print(requests.get("http://127.0.0.1:5000/api?input=Where is
        Paris").text)
        <br />
        # Returns a json object with the following response
        <br />
        '{"data":"Paris is located in France."}'
